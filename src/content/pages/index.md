      **Trees** grow *however* makes them happy. A big strong tree needs big
      <sup>strong</sup> roots. If you do too much it's going to lose its
      effectiveness. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what
      it is. Just beat the devil out of it. That's crazy.


      Just make little strokes like that. No pressure. Just relax and watch it
      happen. It's so important to do something every day that will make you
      happy. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really
      care. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.


      We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get
      everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you
      addicted. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.
      Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
      They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes
      I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You have freedom here. The
      only guide is your heart.


      A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Didn't you know you had that
      much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You want your
      tree to have some character. Make it special. With practice comes
      confidence. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically -
      you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. We'll put all the
      little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.


      If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong
      thing. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there There comes a nice
      little fluffer.


      Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
      framework first. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. There
      isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.


      It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. There is
      immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in
      nature. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our
      minds.
